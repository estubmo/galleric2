# Galleric - Artist Gallery and Store - Built with Strapi/NextJS/Tailwind CSS/Framer Motion and Stripe

This is a full-stack TypeScript example using:

- Frontend:
  - Next.js and [SWR](https://github.com/zeit/swr)
  - [react-stripe-js](https://github.com/stripe/react-stripe-js) for [Checkout](https://stripe.com/checkout) and [Elements](https://stripe.com/elements)
- Backend
  - Next.js [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)
  - [Strapi Headless CMS](https://github.com/strapi/strapi)
  - [Tailwind CSS](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss)
  - [stripe-node with TypeScript](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-node#usage-with-typescript)

## Why?

This is a prototype I've had in the works for a while, that I'm spending my time on between clients or in my free time.
Coming from ReactJS and more traditional backends, like NodeJS, it has been a learning experience. I wanted to learn more about Statically Generated and Server-Side Rendered websites, as opposed to the, by default, client site rendered websites of ReactJS.

I also wanted to learn more about CSS animations, and has thus been learning Framer Motion. I chose FM because it's super intuitive, easy to use with React and has good documentation.

I've also learned TailwindCSS as it's a Utility-first CSS framework which is quite different from what I'm used to, in MaterialUI and Bootstrap.

Having a headless CMS as the backend has been a great experience so far, and the next step for me is to integrate Stripe payments with it.
